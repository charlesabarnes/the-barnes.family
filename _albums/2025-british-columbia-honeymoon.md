Our honeymoon in British Columbia was the perfect blend of city exploration and wilderness adventure. From Vancouver's vibrant neighborhoods to the rugged beauty of Vancouver Island's west coast, every day brought new discoveries. We watched whales breach in the Pacific, wandered through ancient rainforests, and fell in love with the laid-back island life. Tofino's wild beaches and Victoria's charming gardens gave us memories we'll treasure forever. This was more than a honeymoonâ€”it was the first chapter of our married adventure story.
