## Meet the Barnes Family

We're Charles and Kelly Barnes, and together with our beloved dogs Dev and Cobol, we make up the Barnes family. This website is our digital scrapbook—a place to share our journey, adventures, and the moments that make life special.

### Our Story

Our love story began with a shared appreciation for adventure, good food, and the simple joys of life. After eloping in 2024, we've been building a life filled with laughter, exploration, and plenty of dog walks.

### Charles Barnes

Technology enthusiast, problem solver, and the technical mind behind this website. When not coding, you'll find me planning our next adventure or trying to teach Dev new tricks (with varying degrees of success).

### Kelly Barnes

The creative force and heart of our family. Kelly brings warmth, creativity, and an eye for beauty to everything we do. She's the one who makes sure we stop to appreciate the sunset and capture the moments that matter.

### Dev

Our energetic Basenji, Dev is full of personality and mischief. Known for his distinctive yodel and cat-like independence, he keeps us on our toes and reminds us that the best adventures sometimes happen in our own backyard.

### Cobol

Our loyal Border Collie, Cobol is the brains of the dog duo. With boundless energy and an eagerness to please, Cobol is always ready for the next hike, game of fetch, or any activity that involves being part of the action.

## Our Adventures

From our summer trip to Maine in 2024 to our honeymoon exploring Vancouver and Vancouver Island, we believe in making memories and sharing them with the people we love. This website serves as our archive—a place where family and friends can follow along on our journey and download photos to keep for themselves.

## Why This Website?

In an age of fleeting social media posts and scattered digital photos, we wanted to create something more permanent—a proper home for our family's story. Here you'll find:

- Annual Christmas cards and newsletters
- Photo galleries from our travels
- Important announcements and milestones
- A timeline of our adventures together
